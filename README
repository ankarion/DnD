# 🧭 D&D Chronicles

A modular system for tracking multiple D&D worlds with shared tools, documentation, and automation.

> Designed for rotating-player campaigns with isolated worlds and consistent tooling.

## 📁 Structure Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `00./` | First world – includes notes and website scaffold |
| `01.Ervindell/` | Second world – same structure, isolated content |
| `99.System/` | System-wide tools, scripts, media, and rules |
| `.git/hooks/` | Git automation like `pre-commit` and `post-checkout` |

Each world dir is an obsidian dir, use it to explore and edit notes.  
Use GitHub Pages to publish a wiki/blog per world.
