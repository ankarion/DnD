Welcome to my D&D notes database. This whole repository is WIP so there are a lot of POC of ways to order and reorder notes.
# Filesystem convention:
Directories is built on 2 digits.
1st digit stands for:
0 - Some ideas description
1 - Compaigns 
9 - Directory for system files
- World, grouped info about certain worlds
- Rule books, creatures stat blocks

2nd digit shows ordering
