1. **The Infinite Paper Project**  
   The goblin believes they can create a book with infinite pages by folding paper in a specific magical pattern. They spend countless hours on this, trying to add more pages through arcane folding techniques, but end up with a massive, unwieldy paper ball. They're adamant that they’re *so close* to unlocking a "pocket dimension of knowledge."

2. **The Anti-Gravity Blanket**  
   The goblin designs a blanket that supposedly makes objects lighter when placed over them. In practice, it makes things slightly heavier, but the goblin doesn't notice because they keep trying it on progressively smaller objects, convinced the flaw is in the size of the blanket, not the theory.

3. **The Echo-Capturing Bottle**  
   The goblin is obsessed with the idea that echoes can be "caught" and reused. They create a magical bottle designed to trap sound waves so they can study the nature of echoes. However, they frequently bottle mundane sounds—like their own voice—and are disappointed when the sounds don’t contain any hidden secrets.

4. **The Undetectable Color Theory**  
   The goblin spends months developing a new color that no one can see. They describe it in vivid detail, claiming it’s a breakthrough in magical pigment. The rest of the world insists that the color doesn’t exist, but the goblin remains convinced that their discovery has revolutionized art.

5. **The Portable Weather Machine**  
   Convinced that weather patterns can be manipulated on a small scale, the goblin creates a magical device to summon weather in a localized area. However, the machine only summons highly inconvenient weather—like a 5-foot-wide rainstorm, or a single bolt of lightning aimed at the wrong place. The goblin enthusiastically tests it during battle, hoping for a tactical advantage, but usually ends up soaking themselves.

6. **The Reversing Mirror**  
   The goblin develops a mirror that supposedly reverses the past actions of anyone who looks into it. In reality, the mirror just flips the reflection. They’re convinced it’s a powerful tool for time manipulation, though they can’t figure out why it doesn’t work on anything "bigger than a second."

7. **The Thought Projector**  
   This device is designed to project thoughts directly into the air as visible text or images. While the concept is brilliant, the goblin never considered how random or unwanted thoughts might slip through. In social settings, it reveals their bizarre, impulsive ideas, embarrassing the goblin in front of others without them realizing why.

8. **The Teleporting Teapot**  
   The goblin believes they can revolutionize tea-making with a teapot that teleports the liquid directly into cups. The only problem is that it teleports the tea anywhere *except* the intended target. Often, the goblin’s tea ends up in someone else’s bag, boots, or across the room, but they’re convinced that with just a few tweaks, it’ll be flawless.

9. **The Emotion Detector Necklace**  
   This project aims to detect the emotions of nearby creatures and display them with a colored aura. Unfortunately, it only registers the wearer’s current emotional state and wildly misinterprets them. The goblin will walk around, confidently declaring everyone else’s mood based on their own aura, often leading to social confusion and conflict.

10. **The Multi-Layered Cake Theory**  
   Convinced that a cake with an infinite number of layers would create a portal to the astral plane, the goblin obsessively bakes multi-layered cakes. Every cake collapses under its own weight or is eaten before they can test their theory, but they’re *certain* that if they get the layer count just right, they’ll achieve transcendence.

11. **The One-Second Stasis Field**  
   The goblin is working on a device that freezes time for exactly one second. They claim this second is crucial for tactical combat advantage, but in reality, it doesn’t do anything noticeable except make the goblin feel like they’ve done something impressive. They try to use this "powerful" tool at the most critical moments, often to little effect.

12. **The Self-Counting Coin Pouch**  
   This magical coin pouch is supposed to count the exact number of coins inside it at all times. However, the counting mechanism often glitches, randomly spouting incorrect numbers. The goblin, unaware of the error, proudly informs everyone of the wrong amount of gold they possess, leading to awkward situations at merchants.

13. **The Self-Folding Map**  
   Determined to revolutionize navigation, the goblin creates a map that folds itself perfectly for convenience. Unfortunately, the map folds itself at the most inopportune times—usually in the middle of critical navigation moments. Despite this, the goblin insists it’s a huge time-saver and refuses to abandon it.

14. **The Magnetic Compass for Finding Cheese**  
   Convinced that there’s something inherently magical about cheese, the goblin invents a compass designed to point toward the nearest source of cheese. This project has no practical use in adventuring, but the goblin is utterly fascinated by its potential. They often drag the party off-course because the compass leads them to local taverns or rodents.

15. **The Paradox Box**  
   A small, ornate box that the goblin insists contains "everything and nothing at once." They refuse to open it, claiming that doing so would unravel reality. The box is actually empty, but the goblin spends an inordinate amount of time pondering its philosophical implications, writing complex treatises on the nature of existence based on the box’s "contents."

### How These Projects Reflect Their Nature:
- **High Intelligence:** Each project demonstrates advanced thinking and an understanding of magic or science, showing that the goblin can comprehend and manipulate complex concepts.
- **Low Wisdom:** Despite the brilliance behind the projects, none of them have practical applications, and the goblin either overlooks obvious flaws or becomes too fixated on pointless details. They often ignore social, safety, or practical concerns, focusing only on the intellectual challenge.

These projects highlight a goblin who sees the world in abstract and sometimes absurd ways, where the pursuit of knowledge is paramount, even if the results are utterly useless or bizarre.
